<h2>A Message From The Founder</h2>
<p>When I was in eight grade, I discovered the Feluda Mysteries written by Satyajit Ray and Tintin written by Hergé. Ever since, I've loved to read!</p>

<p>One day my friend texted me to send him a list of books that I have.At that moment it struck me to build Snowy.</p>

<p>So I decided to build a website, a place where my friends could share book reviews also can create and share bookshelves.</p>

<p>Snowy is that site. It is a place where you can see what your friends are reading and vice versa. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or want to read).</p>
